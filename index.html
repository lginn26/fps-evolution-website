        <h1>FPS Evolution</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In the 1980s, first person shooters underwent a steady rise to
            popularity with the creation on new techniques that 
            simulate 3D space. What most people don't relize about
            FPS titles in the 1900s is that only a few of the later 
            ones were actually 3D rendered. The onces developed earlier
            used state of the art techniques to make it seems like there
            is a third demention, but really the game is being rendered
            like a top-down shooter off the time. In this website, you
            will learn about the many ways classic shooters simulated 3D
            space using complex coding tricks. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why Simulated 3D Techniques Used</h2>
        
        <p>If you are a frequent player of modern first person
            shooters, you might wonder why these techniques
            would be considered valuble in the first place. Your
            probably saying right now,"Why simulate 3D when you
            can actually make 3D." To start off, actual 3D space 
            back then was impossible to render. The graphics cards
            at the time were to low powered to synthiseis a 3rd demention.
            Therefor, techniques had to be developed to create 
            an illusion of 3D space. 

            Believe it or not, there were benifits to using these techniques
            that wern't obtainable when rendering real 3D. If you take
            a look at the game DOOM some of the levels threw massive
            waves of enemies at you at once; while the 3D rendered title 
            Quake had maybe a few enemies on the screen at a time. Since Quake
            used 3D rendering, they had to cut back the number of enemies that
            were displayed on screen. So, in some cases, not rendering the 3rd
            demenstion allowed the hardware at the time to pull off incredably
            big action scenes and not cut the preformace down doing so.
