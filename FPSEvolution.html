    <h1>FPS Evolution</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the 1980s, first person shooters underwent a steady rise to
        popularity with the creation on new techniques that 
        simulate 3D space. What most people don't relize about
        FPS titles in the 1900s is that only a few of the later 
        ones were actually 3D rendered. The onces developed earlier
        used state of the art techniques to make it seems like there
        is a third demention, but really the game is being rendered
        like a top-down shooter off the time. In this website, you
        will learn about the many ways classic shooters simulated 3D
        space using complex coding tricks.

    <h2>Why Where These Techniques Used</h2>
    
    <p>If you are a frequent player of modern first person
        shooters, you might wonder why these techniques
        would be considered valuble in the first place. Your
        probably saying right now,"Why simulate 3D when you
        can actually make 3D." To start off, actual 3D space 
        back then was impossible to render. The graphics cards
        at the time were to low powered to synthiseis a 3rd demention.
        Therefor, techniques had to be developed to create 
        an illusion of 3D space. 

        Believe it or not, there were benifits to using these techniques
        that wern't obtainable when rendering real 3D. If you take
        a look at the game DOOM some of the levels threw massive
        waves of enemies at you at once; while the 3D rendered title 
        Quake had maybe a few enemies on the screen at a time. Since Quake
        used 3D rendering, they had to cut back the number of enemies that
        were displayed on screen. So, in some cases, not rendering the 3rd
        demenstion allowed the hardware at the time to pull of incredably
        big action scenes and not cut the preformace.
